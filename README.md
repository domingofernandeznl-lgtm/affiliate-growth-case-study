Building and scaling Tomplay's affiliate and influencer program
# Tomplay Affiliate & Influencer Marketing Case Study  
### By Domingo Fernandez Collado

## Overview

During my time at Tomplay, I led the creation and scaling of a full-funnel affiliate and influencer marketing program that became one of the company’s key lead-generation engines. This case study outlines the strategy, execution, and outcomes of that initiative — built from the ground up during a time of global disruption.

## The Challenge

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tomplay needed to scale growth while reducing dependency on traditional paid acquisition. Budgets were tight, CPAs were rising, and we lacked an alternative channel that could drive sustainable, high-quality user acquisition.

## My Approach

**1. Designed a Scalable Creator Program**
- Researched and identified niche influencers across YouTube, education, and music tech.
- Built onboarding workflows, content guidelines, and tiered incentive structures.

**2. Integrated Attribution and Tracking**
- Implemented Tapfiliate and UTM-based tracking.
- Partnered with BI and product teams to refine attribution using AppsFlyer.

**3. Created a High-Conversion Funnel**
- Collaborated with designers and data teams to test multiple creative formats.
- Focused on short-form educational content + long-tail YouTube partnerships.

**4. Optimized Through Experimentation**
- Applied rapid testing cycles to improve ROI.
- Monitored channel-level performance to reallocate budgets efficiently.
